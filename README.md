# Genome-Cache-AR
GenomeCacheAR was ultimately developed for HudsonBiotech in Huntsville, AL during a 32-hour long hackathon by the independent
underground development team The Lituation. The Lituation is comprised of six students from the illustrious Alabama Agricultural
and Mechanical University. We were tasked with creating an Augmented Reality version of a trivia game called Genome Cache, which
was originally developed by HudsonBiotech in efforts to educate humans about the human genome, while creating a virtual journey
along their helix located in McMillian Park at their Huntsville Campus. This was extremely difficult, as it was the team's very first
time attempting anything in AR, but after countless hours we were able to get 3D helixes to appear within the app. In addition to the
AR aspect, we integrated Geolocation within the app, to ping the user's current location, and notify the user where the areas within
the game were along the park for the trivia games to appear.

Unfortunately, we are fairly new to this technology, but, we are still working on it, constantly looking to expand our skillsets, applications
, and minds. With this source code being available for all to use under the Apache 2.0 liscence, we encourage others to work alongside us.
Our next immediate steps are meeting with the software development team at HudsonBiotech to be commissioned to fully create and develop
the AR capacity of Genome Cache.
